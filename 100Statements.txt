Q) We are given 100 statements ->
	1st one says: Atleast one is wrong.
	2nd one says: Atleast two are wrong.
	3rd one says: Atleast three are wrong.
	4th one says: Atleast four are wrong.
	and so on....
	100th one says: Atleast 100 are wrong.

   How many statements are actually wrong and how many are actually right?

Ans) As soon as I looked at this problem first I asked myself ok, what I need. I have to go at 
statement 1 and just say whether it is wrong or right. Similarly I have to look over statement 2 
and just simply decide whether it is wrong or right. And so on. Basically I have to do for all the 
statements. And then at last count the number of statements which are wrong and the number of statements which right.

     Let us first look at what the 100th guy says. He says that atleast 100 statements
     are wrong. Either he is right or he is wrong.
 
     Lets assume that he is right => his statement is right ofcourse => 100 statements are wrong => he himself is wrong.

     Now lets assume that he is wrong. Then he wrong, nothing to dicuss further. So from both the ways he is wrong.
     Hence 100th statement is surely wrong. Hurray we have got one statement which is wrong atleast and this is what
     1st guy said. So he is right for sure.

     Now lets go for the 99th statement. If he is correct => he himself is wrong(this is because the first guy is 
     definitely correct so all other remaining 99 have to be wrong) => he himself is wrong.
 
     And lets now assume that he is wrong. nothing to say again. He is a stupid ass. Both the ways implies that he is wrong.
     So 99th guy is also wrong. It means that the 2nd guy was correct as we have got 100th guy as well the 99th guy both are wrong.

     If we continue our logic in this manner, I can very well say that the first 50 statements are correct and the last 50 statements 
     are wrong.
